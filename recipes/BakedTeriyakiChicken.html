    <h2>What is <em>What Is Teriyaki Chickens</em>?</h2>
    <p>Teriyaki chicken is simply chicken that is coated in teriyaki sauce.<br> The dish comes from the Japanese cooking technique called teriyaki,<br> where meat is grilled or broiled with a soy sauce, mirin, and sugar glaze.<br> Today, teriyaki chicken refers to any chicken with teriyaki sauce regardless of the cooking method.</p>

    <h2>What is <em>Teriyaki</em> sauce?</h2>
    <p>Traditional teriyaki sauce is made up of four ingredients: soy sauce, mirin, ginger, and sugar.<br> But many chefs have their own takes on teriyaki sauce. In this recipe, the teriyaki sauce includes<br> soy sauce, sugar, ginger, cornstarch (for thickening), cider vinegar (instead of mirin), water, garlic, and black pepper.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><strong>Step1</strong><br>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
    <p><strong>Step2</strong><br>Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat.<br> Simmer, stirring frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Step3</strong><br>Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of each thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.</p>
    <p><strong>Step4</strong><br>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step5</strong><br>Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.</p>
